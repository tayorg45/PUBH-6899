This repository contains a class project for an Artificial Intelligence course focused on applying AI techniques to analyze healthcare price data in the United States. Using machine learning and time series methods, the project explores trends in prescription drug prices, hospital service fees, and physician charges relative to overall inflation. The goal is to leverage AI tools for exploratory data analysis and modeling, demonstrating how advanced computational methods can support health policy research and economic analysis.
